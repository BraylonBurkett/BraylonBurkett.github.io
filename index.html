  <center><p style="color:white;">Hey, I'm Braylon. I really enjoy creating various medias, especially coding projects. My most proud creating would be Links OS 5, which I started (and finished it) within the first semester of school. This project originates from the version one of Links, which was actually a search engine built with google in mind created during the summer of '23. Anyways I hope you enjoy my content, I know I enjoy making it.</p></center>

<center><p style="color:white;">Links 5 or "Los5" is a virtual operating system or secondary operating system made to run on even the lowest end of computers. I even personally installed it on my raspberry pi 3b (a really low end device the size of a credit card) and it ran as smooth as butter. It can quite literally run on any operating system created within the last 22 years! The point of Los5 is to give you a good user experience while your primary operating system does all the hard work. If you're interested you can check it out at<a href="https://links-os.github.io">The official Links OS site</a></p></center>

  <center><p style="color:white;">MAPLE is an acronym for Mathematical. Analytical. Processing. Language. Executable. MAPLE is a lightweight, portable coding language made to replace harder languages such as C++ or C. Despite the fact that MAPLE is a one-man-made coding language the first version was made within the span of 2 months(not rushed suprisingly). C++ was in mind when MAPLE was created, due to the language's efficiency and rhythmic nature. You can download the very first edition of MAPLE at<a href="https://maple-links.github.io/">The official MAPLE site</a>The website contains the MAPLE terminal to run your code, and the first edition of the MAPLE Guide. Happy Coding!</p></center>

  <center><p style="color:white;">When im not coding I like to create beats in my free time, I then publish these beats to State of the Tune on Youtube. I don't really plan on adding lyrics to any of my songs due to the nature of the beats, plus its good to take a break from words, you know? Im currently working on an official site for my music as well as other artists that I support. For now you will have to listen to the songs via Youtube:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StateoftheTune/featured">State of the Tune Youtube</a>More albums to come soon!</p></center>
