  <center><p style="color:white;">1. Understanding AI:<br> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the theory and development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that historically required human intelligence. These tasks include recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI is an umbrella term that encompasses various technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP). While there are philosophical debates about whether today’s technologies truly constitute “true” artificial intelligence, most people commonly associate AI with machine learning-powered applications. For instance, ChatGPT uses large language models to generate text in response to questions or comments, while computer vision enables machines to analyze data and interpret visual information. AI has become an integral part of our daily lives, from personalized recommendations in apps to real-time customer support chatbots.

  2. Use Cases for AI: <br>AI finds applications across diverse domains. Here are some notable use cases:
    <br>
  Fraud Detection in Finance: AI analyzes large datasets to detect anomalies or patterns signaling fraudulent behavior. Financial institutions use AI algorithms to identify irregular transactions and prevent financial crimes.
  Healthcare Industry: AI-powered robotics can assist in surgeries near delicate organs or tissues, minimizing blood loss and infection risks.
  Natural Language Processing (NLP): AI-driven language models like ChatGPT can engage in human-like conversations, provide customer support, and even generate written content.
  Recommendation Systems: AI algorithms suggest personalized content, such as movie recommendations on streaming platforms or product recommendations for online shoppers.
  Computer Vision: AI enables machines to interpret visual data, from facial recognition for security purposes to autonomous vehicles identifying road signs and pedestrians.
  In summary, AI continues to evolve, shaping our world and revolutionizing how we interact with technology and information</p></center>
