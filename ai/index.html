  <center><h3 style="color:white;">It's hard to go without hearing about AI these days, it's true you've probably heard of AIs such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copliot, and Google's Gemini. But what is AI, and how does it work?</h3></center>

  <center><h2 style="color:white;">Well, it all started in 1940</h2></center>

  <img align="right" src="images/enigma.jpg" alt="Enigma Machine" width="300" height="250">
  
  <p style="color:white;" align="left">When the <b style="color:red;">Enigma machine</b> was invinted by the Nazis during WWII. The machine was esentially a typewriter that encrypted whatever was typed into it. The machine was belived to be so secure, that it was used to share <b style="color:red;">confidential</b> information, and government secrets. The Enigma machine is the earliest known example of <b style="color:red;">artificial intelligence</b>. Because of it's discovery after the war, we were able to study it and expand on the concept of Artificial Intelligence.</p>

  <img align="left" src="images/ai.jpg" alt="Brain" width="400" height="250">
  
  <p style="color:white;" align="right">Since the 1940's, AIs growth in both popularity and power has <b style="color:red;">boomed</b>. For example, almost every single company in the world, in some way, uses AI. Some of the most common examples of AI's usage in companies are analytical data, customer service, even the most basic functions as simple as looking something up on google. Sure <b style="color:red;">AI has benefits</b>, but also has its cons, such as unreliable outputs, and the possibility of AI being used for <b style="color:red;">malicious purposes</b>.</p>

  <center><h2 style="color:white;">How does it work?</h2></center>
  <img align="right" src="images/neural.png" alt="neuralnetwork" width="308" height="250">
  <p style="color:white;" align="left">AI is made up of complex systems of <b style="color:red;">neural networks</b>, which in reality are just <b style="color:red;">numbers and equations</b>, inputs and outputs. These networks are trained to learn from data. AI will then use that data to make predictions on future inputs. The more data an AI has, the more accurate it will be. This is why AI wasn't as reliable 40 years ago as opposed to now, the more time you give AI to learn, the more <b style="color:red;">accurate it will be</b>.</p>

  <img align="left" src="images/robot.png" alt="robot" width="395" height="375">
  <center>
      <p style="color:white;">Short answer, no. <b style="color:red;">AI will not replace humans</b> in the workplace, but rather assist humans in their already exsisting work tasks. AI alone will not replace entire jobs, but instead replace the tedious and repetitive tasks. Seen in studies, AI has only replaced <b style="color:red;">37%</b> of tasks of employees. So don't worry, <b style="color:red;">your job is safe</b> (for now).</p>

  <center><p style="color:white;">I asked AI to write two paragraphs about the same topic that I chose, "What is AI?", to compare our research. You can view this in the <a href="ai.html" style="color:white;">AI's version</a></p></center>
